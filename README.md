# Free courses/resources for Python Programming
- [Book: Think Python](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/)
  > It has practical exercises, gentle learning curve, starts from basics and then covers more advanced topics.
- [Book: Impractical Python Projects](https://www.kea.nu/files/textbooks/humblelearn2code/impracticalpythonprojects.pdf)
  > Projects are a bit more interesting than the exercises in the previous book. It contains solutions at the end.
- [CS50 AI Programming with Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python)
  > It does not have a lot of guidance for the Python programming itself. But has interesting data science related challenges (I think 12) that are then corrected by a bot. It does not expect coding from scratch, but just filling in specific functions with the "data science" logic.
- [Python for Data Science](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/python-for-data-science/)
  > General purpose course.
